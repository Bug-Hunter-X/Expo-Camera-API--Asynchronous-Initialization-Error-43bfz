# Expo Camera API Asynchronous Initialization Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using Expo's Camera API. The issue arises from accessing camera features before the camera has finished initializing, often due to improper handling of asynchronous operations.

## Bug Description
The bug manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes when trying to use the camera before it's ready.  This might be triggered by trying to take a picture or access other functionalities too early in the component's lifecycle.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring all camera operations are performed only after the camera has successfully initialized. This is done by utilizing the `Camera.getStatusAsync()` method and properly managing asynchronous operations.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2.  `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the app using Expo CLI: `expo start`
